# ClockIn-Out
This is a code for a ClockIn/Out discord bot. You can create the bot Just for ClockIn/Out or add it to your other bot. It's a simple bit of code which works effectively. It is used to log hours within a FiveM server Dpt. like PD or EMS.
The Commands are !clockin, !clockout, !hours, !adminhours @user, !addtime @user <minutes>, !removetime @user <minutes>. All of these commands can be seen within the code.
To run the code you need to open a terminal and type "python bot.py". I coded this bot in VS Code,  all information will be highlighted in green and should come after "#".

__How to install__
1. Download the file 
2. Once you've read both of the .txt files you may/can delete them
3. Create a a new app in the discord developer portal - https://discord.com/developers/applications
4. Once you've created your bot, reset the token then copy it into the code
5. Open the bot.py file in VS Code or any other coding software
6. Fill in all of the required information (BOT Token etc..)
7. Make sure to save the updates
8. Invite the bot to your server 
9. Run the bot through VS Code or your VPS (python bot.py)
